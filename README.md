# Motion-Planning for Autonomous driving

### 1. Objective
In this project, i have designed a Motion Planning approach based on Self-driving specilization course and implemented correspond algorithm using Python. The approach is simulated and tested in Carla simulaitor, which is a solid and modificable opensource project aiming to make it easy for autonomous-driving test/simulation in complex and various situations.
